## Welcome to Learning & Sharing - Projects, Ideas, Articles

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/siddhant45/BusinessStatsbySid/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Welcome to this space, the purpose of this space is to learn together about Data Analytics/Machine Learning and its applications.

In this space, we will share our knowledge about:

Basics of Data Analytics in different domains such as Mergers & Acquisitions, Healthcare, Consumer & Retail etc.
Business Statistics and its applications.
Discuss different case studies and its applications in varied domains.
Algorithms in Data Science and Machine Learning such as Regression Analysis, Decision Trees, Random Forest etc.
Share analysis and articles from other platforms such as Medium, GitHub, Datacamp, Kaggle etc.
Please feel free to post your content in this space. I would love to collaborate with each one of you and make this a fun learning.
